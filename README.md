There are 3 kinds of plots, each working under different conditions (for k,k'>0):

| Plot | # of Indicators | # of Countries | Years Range | Time Aggregation |
| :---: | :-------: | :-------: | :---: | :--------------: |
| Timeline | k | k' | Any | Yes |
| Bar | k | k' | Any | Yes |
| Scatter | 2 | 0 | Specific year | No |
| Scatter | 2 | 1 | Any | Yes |

## How to add more data
1. Go to [WorldBank](http://data.worldbank.org/)
2. Download a .zip file for the country you want.
3. Extract it into 3 files and save each on the corresponding folder in "../DBMS/data/original/":
    1. "countries/"
    2. "indicators/"
    3. "stats/"
4. The new files will be loaded along with the old ones when the app is run.
